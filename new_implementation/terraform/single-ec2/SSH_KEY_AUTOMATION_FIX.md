# SSH Key Automation Fix - No More Manual Input Required

## ❌ **The Problem**
The `deploy_app.sh` script always prompted for manual SSH key input:
```
Warning: Could not get key name from Terraform output
Please enter your EC2 key pair name: 
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The Terraform configuration was missing an **output** for the `key_name` variable. Even though `var.key_name` was used throughout the configuration, it wasn't exposed as an output that the deploy script could retrieve.

## ✅ **The Fix**

### **1. Added Missing Output to main.tf**
```hcl
output "key_name" {
  value = var.key_name
  description = "EC2 Key Pair name used for SSH access"
}
```

### **2. Improved Deploy Script Logic**
```bash
# Get key name from Terraform (with improved method)
echo -e "${YELLOW}Retrieving SSH key name from Terraform...${NC}"
KEY_NAME=$(terraform output -raw key_name 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$KEY_NAME" ]; then
    # Fallback: try JSON method
    KEY_NAME=$(terraform output -json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.key_name.value // empty' 2>/dev/null)
fi

if [ -z "$KEY_NAME" ]; then
    echo -e "${YELLOW}Warning: Could not get key name from Terraform output${NC}"
    echo -e "${YELLOW}This usually means terraform hasn't been applied yet or there's an issue with the configuration${NC}"
    read -p "Please enter your EC2 key pair name: " KEY_NAME
else
    echo -e "${GREEN}Retrieved key name from Terraform: $KEY_NAME${NC}"
fi
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of This Fix**

### **1. Fully Automated Deployment**
- ✅ No more manual key name input required
- ✅ Script retrieves all info from Terraform automatically
- ✅ Smoother deployment experience

### **2. Better Error Handling**
- ✅ Uses `terraform output -raw` (cleaner than JSON parsing)
- ✅ Fallback to JSON method if needed
- ✅ Clear feedback about what's happening
- ✅ Helpful troubleshooting messages

### **3. Improved User Experience**
```bash
# Before (always manual)
Warning: Could not get key name from Terraform output
Please enter your EC2 key pair name: █

# After (automatic)
✅ Retrieving SSH key name from Terraform...
✅ Retrieved key name from Terraform: helgeKeyPair
✅ Using key file: ~/.ssh/helgeKeyPair.pem
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

After applying this fix:

```bash
# 1. Apply Terraform configuration
terraform apply

# 2. Run deploy script (should be fully automatic now)
./deploy_app.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ Getting instance IP from Terraform...
# ✅ Found instance IP: 1.2.3.4
# ✅ Retrieving SSH key name from Terraform...
# ✅ Retrieved key name from Terraform: your-key-name
# ✅ Using key file: ~/.ssh/your-key-name.pem
# ... (continues with automatic deployment)
```

## 📝 **Other Available Terraform Outputs**
With the fix, all these outputs are now available:
- `instance_id`: EC2 instance ID
- `public_ip`: Public IP address
- `public_dns`: Public DNS name
- `key_name`: SSH key pair name ← **NEW!**
- `ssh_command`: Ready-to-use SSH command
- `api_url`: API endpoint URL

## 🎯 **Complete Automation Achieved**
The deployment process is now **100% automated**:
1. `terraform apply` - Provisions infrastructure
2. `./deploy_app.sh` - Automatically retrieves all info and deploys app
3. No manual input required!
