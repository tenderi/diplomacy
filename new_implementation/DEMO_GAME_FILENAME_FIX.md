# Demo Game Filename Ordering Fix

## Problem

The automated demo game was generating maps with filenames that didn't sort in the correct order:
- `demo_01_1901_Spring_Movement_initial.png`
- `demo_01_1901_Spring_Movement_orders.txt` (should be .png)
- `demo_01_1901_Spring_Movement_resolution.txt` (should be .png)
- `demo_01_1901_Spring_Movement_final.png`

**Issues:**
1. Orders and resolution maps were saved as `.txt` files instead of `.png`
2. When sorted alphabetically, files didn't appear in generation order (final comes before initial alphabetically)

## Solution

### 1. Added Numeric Prefixes for Ordering

Changed filename format from:
```
demo_{counter}_{year}_{season}_{phase}_{type}.png
```

To:
```
demo_{counter}_{year}_{season}_{phase}_{step}_{type}.png
```

Where `step` is:
- `01` for initial
- `02` for orders
- `03` for resolution
- `04` for final

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Added verification to ensure:
- Maps directory exists before creating files
- SVG map file exists before attempting rendering
- PNG files are actually created after rendering
- Better error messages with traceback

## Files Modified

**`demo_automated_game.py`**:
- Updated filename generation in `play_game()` method to include step numbers
- Enhanced `generate_and_save_map()` with directory creation and file verification
- Enhanced `generate_orders_map()` with better error handling and PNG verification
- Enhanced `generate_resolution_map()` with better error handling and PNG verification

## New Filename Format

**Example filenames:**
```
demo_01_1901_Spring_Movement_01_initial.png
demo_01_1901_Spring_Movement_02_orders.png
demo_01_1901_Spring_Movement_03_resolution.png
demo_01_1901_Spring_Movement_04_final.png
demo_02_1901_Spring_Builds_01_initial.png
demo_02_1901_Spring_Builds_02_orders.png
demo_02_1901_Spring_Builds_03_resolution.png
demo_02_1901_Spring_Builds_04_final.png
```

**Sorting behavior:**
When sorted alphabetically, files now appear in the correct generation order:
1. Initial state
2. Orders map
3. Resolution map
4. Final state

## Benefits

1. **Correct ordering**: Files sort alphabetically in generation order
2. **Consistent format**: All map types use `.png` extension
3. **Better debugging**: Enhanced error handling helps identify issues
4. **Predictable naming**: Clear pattern for automated processing

## Testing

Verified that:
- ✅ Filenames sort correctly in alphabetical order
- ✅ Pattern matches expected format
- ✅ All map types generate PNG files
- ✅ Error handling works correctly
- ✅ No linter errors

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Demo game now generates maps with proper ordering and PNG format for all map types.
