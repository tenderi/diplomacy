# Plan for Rewriting Diplomacy Board Game Server in Python

## 1. Analyze the Old Implementation
- List all major modules, classes, and features in the Java codebase.
- Document the overall architecture and data flow.

## 2. Define Requirements and Goals
- Specify the core features to be supported in the Python version.
- Identify any improvements or changes from the old implementation.

## 3. Design the New Architecture
- Propose a modular structure for the Python project.
- Define key classes, modules, and their responsibilities.
- Plan for extensibility and testing.

## 4. Migration Plan
- Prioritize which modules to rewrite first (e.g., game logic, networking, UI).
- Outline a step-by-step migration and testing strategy.

## 5. Implementation Specs
- For each module, write a specification file describing its purpose, API, and expected behavior.
- Include example usage and test cases.

## 6. Testing and Validation
- Define a testing strategy (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- Plan for automated tests and continuous integration.

## 7. Documentation
- Plan for user and developer documentation.
- Specify documentation tools and structure.

# Step-by-Step Action Plan for Diplomacy Python Rewrite

1. Familiarize with Specifications and Plans
   - Review all files in `new_implementation/specs/` to understand the specifications and current planning.
   - Pay special attention to `fix_plan.md` for the current prioritized to-do list.

2. Analyze the Old Implementation
   - List all major modules, classes, and features in `old_implementation/`.
   - Document the overall architecture and data flow for reference to `/new_implementation/specs/`

3. Study the New Implementation Source Code
   - Review all code in `new_implementation/src/`.
   - Compare the implementation against the specifications in `specs/`.
   - Search for TODOs, minimal implementations, and placeholders in the code.
   - Note any missing, incomplete, or incorrect features.

4. Update and Prioritize fix_plan.md
   - Create or update `fix_plan.md` as a bullet-point list, sorted by priority, of items yet to be implemented or fixed.
   - Mark items as complete/incomplete as appropriate.
   - If new modules are needed, document their implementation plan in `fix_plan.md`.
   - Always create tests first before making implementations.

5. Study Example Code
   - Review all code in `new_implementation/examples/`.
   - Compare examples against the specifications and compiler requirements.
   - Identify missing or incomplete example coverage.

6. Update fix_plan.md for Examples
   - Add to `fix_plan.md` any missing or incomplete example implementations, sorted by priority.

7. Define Requirements and Goals
   - Specify the core features to be supported in the Python version.
   - Identify improvements or changes from the old implementation.

8. Design the New Architecture
   - Propose a modular structure for the Python project.
   - Define key classes, modules, and their responsibilities.
   - Plan for extensibility and testing.

9. Plan Migration Steps
   - Prioritize which modules to rewrite first (e.g., game logic, networking, UI).
   - Outline a step-by-step migration and testing strategy.

10. Write/Update Implementation Specs
    - For each module, write or update a specification file describing its purpose, API, and expected behavior.
    - Include example usage and test cases.

11. Testing and Validation
    - Define and implement a testing strategy (unit, integration, end-to-end).
    - Plan and set up automated tests and continuous integration.

12. Documentation
    - Plan and write user and developer documentation.
    - Specify and use documentation tools and structure.

13. Iterative Review and Update
    - Regularly review progress, update `fix_plan.md`, and adjust priorities as needed.
    - Use subagents (or parallel review) to accelerate code and spec analysis.

Refer to this plan as you proceed step by step. Update as needed during the project.
