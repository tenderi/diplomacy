# Diplomacy Python Server: Concise Plan

## Ultimate Goal
- Play Diplomacy with friends in a Telegram channel, with a bot as game master.
- Bot automates all phases, adjudication, and communication per standard rules.
- Players interact only via Telegram; multiple games supported.

## Steps
1. **Review Specs & Plans**
   - Read all `specs/` files, especially `fix_plan.md`.
2. **Analyze Old Implementation**
   - List key modules/classes in `old_implementation/`.
   - Document architecture/data flow.
3. **Review & Compare New Code**
   - Check `src/` for missing/incomplete features.
   - Note TODOs and placeholders.
4. **Update fix_plan.md**
   - List/prioritize tasks; mark progress.
   - Add new modules/tests as needed.
5. **Check Examples**
   - Review `examples/` for coverage.
   - Add missing examples to `fix_plan.md`.
6. **Define Requirements**
   - Focus on Telegram integration and rules compliance.
7. **Design Architecture**
   - Modular structure; define key classes/modules (including Telegram bot).
8. **Plan Migration**
   - Prioritize modules (game logic, Telegram bot, etc.).
   - Outline migration/testing steps.
9. **Write/Update Specs**
   - For each module: purpose, API, usage, tests.
10. **Testing & Validation**
    - Implement unit/integration/e2e tests; set up CI.
11. **Documentation**
    - Write user/dev docs; specify tools/structure.
12. **Iterative Review**
    - Regularly update `fix_plan.md` and priorities.
