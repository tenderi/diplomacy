# Testing and Validation Strategy

## Overview
Testing is critical for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the Diplomacy Python implementation. This strategy covers unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, as well as continuous integration (CI) setup.

## 1. Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for each module (engine, map, power, order, server, client, etc.)
- Place tests in a `tests/` directory or next to the source code
- Use pytest or unittest as the test framework
- Cover all public methods and edge cases

## 2. Integration Testing
- Write tests that cover interactions between modules (e.g., game engine + order parsing)
- Simulate real game scenarios and validate state transitions

## 3. End-to-End Testing
- Test the full workflow: server startup, game creation, player actions, turn processing, and game completion
- Use the minimal client interface to drive these tests

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI)
- Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI)
- Run all tests automatically on each commit and pull request
- Fail builds on test failures

## 5. Test Coverage and Maintenance
- Track test coverage and aim for high coverage, especially for core logic
- Update and expand tests as new features are added or bugs are fixed
- Document how to run tests in the project README

This strategy should be updated as the project evolves and new testing needs are identified.
