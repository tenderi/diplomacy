# Telegram Channel Integration Specification

## Overview

This specification defines how the Diplomacy bot can integrate with Telegram channels to provide enhanced multiplayer gaming experiences. Instead of purely private bot interactions, games can be "linked" to channels where public game information, maps, and broadcasts are shared with all players.

## Core Concept

**Channel-Linked Games**: Games that are associated with a specific Telegram channel where:
- All players are members of the channel
- The bot has posting permissions in the channel
- Public game information is automatically shared
- Players can interact with game content in a social environment

## Primary Channel Features

- Phase changes (Movement → Retreat → Build)
- After order adjudication
- Manual admin request

**Content:**

- Next deadline countdown

**Message Format:**
```

- Read message history (for context)

**Channel Admin Controls:**

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

**New Tables:**
```sql
-- Channel linking
CREATE TABLE game_channels (
    game_id INTEGER REFERENCES games(id),
    channel_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    channel_name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    PRIMARY KEY (game_id, channel_id)
);

-- Channel message tracking
CREATE TABLE channel_messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    game_id INTEGER REFERENCES games(id),
    channel_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    message_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    message_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'map', 'broadcast', 'notification'
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Player channel membership
CREATE TABLE player_channel_membership (
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    game_id INTEGER REFERENCES games(id),
    channel_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, game_id, channel_id)
);
```

### API Endpoints

**Channel Management:**
```python
POST /games/{game_id}/channel/link          # Link channel to game
DELETE /games/{game_id}/channel/unlink      # Unlink channel
GET /games/{game_id}/channel/settings       # Get channel settings
PUT /games/{game_id}/channel/settings       # Update channel settings
POST /games/{game_id}/channel/broadcast     # Send broadcast message
```

**Channel Content:**
```python
GET /games/{game_id}/channel/messages       # Get channel message history
POST /games/{game_id}/channel/map           # Post current map
POST /games/{game_id}/channel/status        # Post game status
GET /games/{game_id}/channel/analytics      # Get channel engagement data
```

### Bot Integration Points

**Event Hooks:**
- `on_turn_start()` → Post new turn notification + map
- `on_orders_deadline()` → Post deadline reminders
- `on_adjudication_complete()` → Post battle results + updated map
- `on_phase_change()` → Post phase transition notification
- `on_broadcast_message()` → Forward to channel with formatting
- `on_player_elimination()` → Post elimination announcement
- `on_game_end()` → Post victory announcement + final map
