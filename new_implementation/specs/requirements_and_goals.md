# Requirements and Goals for Diplomacy Python Implementation

## Core Features to Support
- Game state management (board, units, powers, phases)
- Turn processing and order resolution (adjudication)
- Map representation and loading (support for standard and variant maps)
- Player (power) management and assignment
- Order parsing, validation, and execution
- Server loop to accept/process game commands (CLI or API)
- Minimal client interface for testing
- Test suite for core game logic and order resolution

## Improvements/Changes from Old Implementation
- Modern Python codebase (type hints, modular structure, testability)
- Improved test coverage and automation
- Clear separation of core logic, server, and client interfaces
- Extensible architecture for future features (variants, bots, web UI)
- Better documentation and developer onboarding
- Enhanced error handling and logging
