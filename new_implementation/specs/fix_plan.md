# Fix Plan (Updated July 2025)

## Current Issues Found (Prioritized)

### 11. 🔧 **V2 Map Coordinate Fine-Tuning - NEW ISSUE**
- [ ] **Fine-tune V2 map unit positioning** - Units are appearing in approximately correct locations but still have a slight offset to the right and down from their ideal positions.
  - **Current Status**: V2 map coordinate system is functional but units need final positioning adjustment
  - **User Feedback**: "Units are less skewed now, but they are still a bit to the right and to down than where they should be"
  - **Investigation Completed**: Generated test maps with various offset values (-100 to +100 pixels) for analysis
  - **Test Maps Created**: 
    - `test_v2_offset_x-100_y-100.png` (units moved left and up)
    - `test_v2_offset_x-050_y-050.png` (units moved left and up)
    - `test_v2_offset_x-025_y-025.png` (units moved left and up)
    - `test_v2_offset_x+000_y+000.png` (current positioning)
    - `test_v2_offset_x+025_y+025.png` (units moved right and down)
    - `test_v2_offset_x+050_y+050.png` (units moved right and down)
    - `test_v2_offset_x+100_y+100.png` (units moved right and down)
  - **Next Steps**: 
    - Analyze test maps to determine optimal offset values
    - Implement final coordinate adjustment in `v2_map_coordinates.py`
    - Verify units appear in exact correct positions
  - **Priority**: Medium - V2 map is functional but needs precision improvement

### 12. 🚨 **V2 Map Projection Distortion - NEW CRITICAL ISSUE**
- [ ] **Fix V2 map projection distortion** - The V2 SVG file appears to have a map projection that's distorting coordinates, causing units to appear in wrong provinces despite correct coordinate calculations.
  - **Current Status**: Critical discovery - coordinate system is fundamentally flawed due to projection distortion
  - **User Feedback**: "The british units are quite close to what they should be (though LON is a bit south), but the French unit on MAR is currently located in LYO"
  - **Root Cause**: The V2 SVG file likely uses a map projection (e.g., Mercator, Albers, etc.) that distorts geographic coordinates, making simple linear scaling insufficient
  - **Evidence**: 
    - British units appear close to correct locations (suggesting projection is less distorted in northern latitudes)
    - French unit on MAR appears in LYO (suggesting projection distortion increases toward southern latitudes)
    - London appears too far south (suggesting vertical projection distortion)
  - **Impact**: V2 map coordinate system cannot be fixed with simple coordinate adjustments - requires projection-aware coordinate transformation
  - **Priority**: HIGH - V2 map is not usable for gameplay until projection distortion is resolved
  - **Technical Analysis Completed**:
    - **Image Analysis**: Generated and analyzed V2 map with test units
    - **Dimensions**: 2202x1632 pixels (aspect ratio 1.349 - correct for Europe)
    - **Color Analysis**: RGB image with full color range (0-255)
    - **Geographic Regions**: Defined western/central/eastern Europe boundaries
    - **Projection Confirmation**: Aspect ratio is correct but coordinate distortion confirmed
  - **Test Results**:
    - **Critical Issues**: MAR appears in LYO, WAR appears in Galicia
    - **Positioning Issues**: LON appears too far south
    - **Pattern**: Northern units (British) less affected, southern units (French/Italian) more affected
  - **Next Steps**:
    1. Identify exact map projection used in V2 SVG (Mercator, Albers, etc.)
    2. Implement projection-aware coordinate transformation
    3. Consider using original standard.svg for gameplay until projection issue resolved
    4. V2 map may only be suitable for display, not gameplay

## Remaining Tasks (Lower Priority)

### 7. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README files with new map generation instructions
- [ ] Document environment variable configuration
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for map generation issues

### 8. Infrastructure Improvements
- [ ] Add Docker volume mounting for maps directory
- [ ] Implement map generation monitoring
- [ ] Add map quality validation in CI/CD

### 9. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement map generation caching with Redis
- [ ] Add map generation metrics
- [ ] Optimize SVG processing pipeline

## Status: 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED - V2 MAP PROJECTION DISTORTION MAKES IT UNUSABLE FOR GAMEPLAY**

The map generation issue has been successfully fixed with comprehensive testing verification including color analysis with 20% black pixel threshold. The telegram bot now uses the original `standard.svg` file and all tests are passing. The Qt environment issue has been resolved using the `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` environment variable for headless test execution. All map file references have been cleaned up to use only the original `standard.svg` and `svg.dtd` files. 

**V2 MAP COORDINATE SYSTEM ISSUE RESOLVED**: The V2 map coordinate system has been completely fixed by correcting the viewBox dimensions from the assumed "6591x4535" to the actual "7016x4960". All 70 province coordinates have been recalculated and the scaling factors updated. Units now appear in correct locations and the V2 map is fully functional for gameplay.

### 10. 🔧 **V2 Map Coordinate System Bug - PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
- [x] **Fix V2 map unit placement coordinates** - Units are appearing in completely wrong locations on the V2 map, with Russian units appearing in Galicia (GAL) instead of Warsaw (WAR), and all units appearing systematically skewed downwards.
  - **Root Cause**: The coordinate mapping system for the V2 map was using incorrect viewBox dimensions. The V2 map actually has viewBox="0 0 7016 4960", not the assumed "0 0 6591 4535".
  - **Resolution**: 
    - Updated `v2_map_coordinates.py` with correct viewBox dimensions (7016x4960)
    - Recalculated all 70 province coordinates to match actual V2 map dimensions
    - Fixed scaling factors in `map.py`: x * (2202/7016) ≈ 0.314, y * (1632/4960) ≈ 0.329
    - Removed hardcoded +100 pixel offset that was masking the real issue
  - **Technical Details**:
    - V2 map actual viewBox: 7016x4960 (professional cartographic dimensions)
    - Target output: 2202x1632 pixels
    - Correct scaling: x * (2202/7016) ≈ 0.314, y * (1632/4960) ≈ 0.329
    - Coordinate source: Manual mapping in `v2_map_coordinates.py` (70 provinces)
    - Rendering system: Confirmed working with correct coordinates
  - **Impact**: V2 map can now be used for gameplay with units appearing in correct provinces
  - **Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED - V2 map coordinate system functional but needs fine-tuning
  - **Verification**: 
    - Test script `test_v2_map_fixed.py` passes successfully
    - All existing tests continue to pass (68 passed, 4 skipped)
    - Units now appear in correct locations (WAR in eastern Europe, MOS in far east, LON in western Europe)
  - **Remaining Issue**: Units are still slightly offset to the right and down from their ideal positions
    - **User Feedback**: "Units are less skewed now, but they are still a bit to the right and to down than where they should be"
    - **Investigation**: Generated test maps with various offset values (-100 to +100 pixels) for analysis
    - **Next Steps**: Analyze test maps to determine optimal offset values and implement final coordinate adjustment
