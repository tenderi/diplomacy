# Fix Plan (Updated October 2025)

## Current Issues Found (Prioritized)

### 2. **Multiple Order Submission Bug** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Current Status**: Bug identified, root cause found, and successfully fixed
- **Issue Description**: When submitting multiple orders one-by-one using `/selectunit`, only the last order is saved
  - User submitted 3 orders: `A BER - SIL`, `A MUN - TYR`, `F KIE - BAL`
  - Only `F KIE - BAL` (the last one) was processed and stored
  - Issue affects both individual order submission and batch order submission
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - **Initial Hypothesis**: Server command was replacing orders instead of appending
  - **Investigation Findings**: 
    - Server logs show each order is processed individually: `DEBUG: Set orders for GERMANY: ['A BER - SIL']`, then `['A MUN - TYR']`, then `['F KIE - BAL']`
    - Each order appears to be processed correctly in the server command
    - Issue persists even when submitting all orders at once via API
    - Game state retrieval shows only the last order: `{"GERMANY": ["F KIE - BAL"]}`
- **Root Cause Found**: 
  - **Issue**: Premature database cleanup logic in `api.py` lines 207-217
  - **Problem**: Cleanup ran after EVERY order submission, not after all orders submitted
  - **Sequence**: Order submitted ‚Üí stored in game object ‚Üí cleanup deletes from DB ‚Üí re-adds only current orders ‚Üí game state update overwrites DB
  - **Result**: Each order submission overwrote previous orders in database
- **Successful Fix**: 
  - **Solution**: Removed premature database cleanup logic in `api.py` lines 207-217
  - **Change**: Replaced cleanup logic with simple comment explaining that database sync happens via game state update
  - **Result**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - All orders now properly stored and retrieved
  - **Verification**: 
    - Individual order submission: ‚úÖ All 3 orders stored correctly
    - Batch order submission: ‚úÖ All 3 orders stored correctly
    - Game state retrieval: ‚úÖ Shows all orders: `{"GERMANY": ["A BER - SIL", "A MUN - TYR", "F KIE - BAL"]}`
- **Priority**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Core gameplay functionality restored
- **Resolution Date**: October 2, 2025
- **Files Modified**: `src/server/api.py` (removed premature cleanup logic)

### 3. **Same-Unit Order Conflict Resolution** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Current Status**: Bug identified and successfully fixed
- **Issue Description**: When submitting multiple orders for the same unit before processing the turn, both orders were stored instead of keeping only the latest one
  - User submitted: `A BER - SIL` then `A BER - PRU`
  - System incorrectly stored both orders: `["A BER - SIL", "A BER - PRU"]`
  - Expected behavior: Only `A BER - PRU` should be stored
- **Root Cause**: Server logic only checked for exact duplicate orders, not orders from the same unit
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `src/server/server.py` to parse orders and extract unit information
  - Added `_is_same_unit_order()` helper method to detect conflicting orders
  - Implemented logic to remove existing orders for the same unit before adding new order
- **Verification**: 
  - Same unit conflict: ‚úÖ Only latest order kept (`A BER - PRU`)
  - Different units: ‚úÖ Both orders preserved (`A BER - PRU`, `A MUN - TYR`)
- **Priority**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Proper Diplomacy rule implementation
- **Resolution Date**: October 2, 2025
- **Files Modified**: `src/server/server.py` (added unit conflict resolution logic)

### 4. **Convoy Movement Support in /selectunit** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Current Status**: Feature successfully implemented and tested
- **Issue Description**: The `/selectunit` interactive order feature was missing convoy movement support
  - Users could only select Hold, Move, and Support orders
  - Convoy orders (essential for fleets) were not available in the interactive interface
  - Required manual order entry: `/order F LON C ENGLAND A LVP - BEL`
- **Diplomacy Rules Implementation**:
  - **Convoy Rule**: A fleet in a body of water may convoy an army from any coastal province to any other coastal province that shares the same body of water
  - **Format**: `F Nth C A Lon-Bel` (fleet convoys army to destination)
  - **Multiple Convoys**: Multiple fleets can convoy through adjacent bodies of water
  - **Foreign Armies**: Can convoy foreign armies with format like `F Nth C ENGLISH A Lon-Bel`
- **Solution Implementation**:
  - **Added Convoy Button**: Fleets now show "üö¢ Convoy" option in `/selectunit`
  - **Convoy Selection Flow**: Fleet ‚Üí Select Army to Convoy ‚Üí Select Destination ‚Üí Submit Order
  - **Interactive UI**: Step-by-step convoy order creation with visual feedback
  - **Callback Handlers**: Added `convoy_select_` and `convoy_dest_` callback handlers
  - **Order Generation**: Automatically generates proper convoy order format
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - **Files Modified**: `src/server/telegram_bot.py`
  - **New Functions**: `show_convoy_options()`, `show_convoy_destinations()`
  - **Callback Handlers**: Added convoy selection and destination selection handlers
  - **Order Format**: Generates orders like `F LON C ENGLAND A LVP - BEL`
- **Verification**: 
  - Convoy order submission: ‚úÖ Order accepted and stored correctly
  - Interactive flow: ‚úÖ Fleet ‚Üí Army ‚Üí Destination selection working
  - Order format: ‚úÖ Proper Diplomacy convoy format generated
- **Priority**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Complete convoy functionality in interactive interface
- **Resolution Date**: October 3, 2025
- **Files Modified**: `src/server/telegram_bot.py` (added convoy UI and handlers)
- **Technical Details**:
  - **Server Command Flow**: `/selectunit` ‚Üí `submit_interactive_order` ‚Üí `api_post("/games/set_orders")` ‚Üí `server.process_command("SET_ORDERS")`
  - **Database vs Game Object**: Game state is retrieved from `server.games[game_id].get_state()`, not database
  - **Order Storage**: Orders stored in both `game.orders[power_name]` (in-memory) and `OrderModel` (database)
  - **Synchronization Issue**: Possible mismatch between in-memory game object and database state
- **Debugging Evidence**:
  - Server logs show each order processed individually with correct debug output
  - Game state retrieval consistently shows only last order
  - Issue affects both individual and batch order submission
  - Problem appears to be in order persistence/retrieval, not order processing
- **Next Investigation Steps**:
  1. **Game Object State**: Check if game object is being overwritten between order submissions
  2. **Database Synchronization**: Verify if database state is overwriting game object state
  3. **Game Restoration**: Check if game is being restored from database between calls
  4. **Race Conditions**: Investigate potential race conditions in order processing
  5. **State Persistence**: Verify game state persistence mechanism
- **Workaround**: Use `/orders <game_id> <order1>; <order2>; <order3>` format (though this may have same issue)
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Affects core gameplay functionality
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days for root cause identification and fix

### 3. **Retreat, Build, and Destroy Order Implementation** (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Current Status**: Order specification updated with comprehensive retreat/build/destroy rules
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Current test suite covers ~40% of order specification
  - ‚úÖ **Currently Tested**: Movement (`-`), Support (`S`), Convoy (`C`), Hold (`H`) orders
  - ‚ùå **Missing Tests**: Retreat, Build, Destroy orders and phase-specific validation
  - ‚ùå **Missing Implementation**: All three new order types not implemented in OrderParser

    - Update validation to check phase appropriateness
    - Add validation for retreat destination constraints
    - Add validation for build/destroy eligibility
    - Add comprehensive test coverage for all legal/illegal examples from order_spec.md
