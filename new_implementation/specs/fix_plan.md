# Fix Plan (Updated October 2025)

## Current Issues Found (Prioritized)

### 1. üîß **V2 Map Development - SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY**
- **Current Status**: V2 map is not usable for gameplay due to fundamental projection distortion
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - **Projection Distortion**: V2 map uses Albers Equal-Area projection causing coordinate skewing
  - **Failed Fix Attempts**: Projection-aware coordinate transformation made coordinates worse
  - **Coordinate System**: Units appearing in wrong provinces despite correct calculations
- **Decision**: Focus on standard map solution instead
- **Priority**: LOW - V2 map development suspended indefinitely

## Remaining Tasks (Lower Priority)

### 2. **Multiple Order Submission Bug** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Current Status**: Bug identified, root cause found, and successfully fixed
- **Issue Description**: When submitting multiple orders one-by-one using `/selectunit`, only the last order is saved
  - User submitted 3 orders: `A BER - SIL`, `A MUN - TYR`, `F KIE - BAL`
  - Only `F KIE - BAL` (the last one) was processed and stored
  - Issue affects both individual order submission and batch order submission
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - **Initial Hypothesis**: Server command was replacing orders instead of appending
  - **Investigation Findings**: 
    - Server logs show each order is processed individually: `DEBUG: Set orders for GERMANY: ['A BER - SIL']`, then `['A MUN - TYR']`, then `['F KIE - BAL']`
    - Each order appears to be processed correctly in the server command
    - Issue persists even when submitting all orders at once via API
    - Game state retrieval shows only the last order: `{"GERMANY": ["F KIE - BAL"]}`
- **Root Cause Found**: 
  - **Issue**: Premature database cleanup logic in `api.py` lines 207-217
  - **Problem**: Cleanup ran after EVERY order submission, not after all orders submitted
  - **Sequence**: Order submitted ‚Üí stored in game object ‚Üí cleanup deletes from DB ‚Üí re-adds only current orders ‚Üí game state update overwrites DB
  - **Result**: Each order submission overwrote previous orders in database
- **Successful Fix**: 
  - **Solution**: Removed premature database cleanup logic in `api.py` lines 207-217
  - **Change**: Replaced cleanup logic with simple comment explaining that database sync happens via game state update
  - **Result**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - All orders now properly stored and retrieved
  - **Verification**: 
    - Individual order submission: ‚úÖ All 3 orders stored correctly
    - Batch order submission: ‚úÖ All 3 orders stored correctly
    - Game state retrieval: ‚úÖ Shows all orders: `{"GERMANY": ["A BER - SIL", "A MUN - TYR", "F KIE - BAL"]}`
- **Priority**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Core gameplay functionality restored
- **Resolution Date**: October 2, 2025
- **Files Modified**: `src/server/api.py` (removed premature cleanup logic)
- **Technical Details**:
  - **Server Command Flow**: `/selectunit` ‚Üí `submit_interactive_order` ‚Üí `api_post("/games/set_orders")` ‚Üí `server.process_command("SET_ORDERS")`
  - **Database vs Game Object**: Game state is retrieved from `server.games[game_id].get_state()`, not database
  - **Order Storage**: Orders stored in both `game.orders[power_name]` (in-memory) and `OrderModel` (database)
  - **Synchronization Issue**: Possible mismatch between in-memory game object and database state
- **Debugging Evidence**:
  - Server logs show each order processed individually with correct debug output
  - Game state retrieval consistently shows only last order
  - Issue affects both individual and batch order submission
  - Problem appears to be in order persistence/retrieval, not order processing
- **Next Investigation Steps**:
  1. **Game Object State**: Check if game object is being overwritten between order submissions
  2. **Database Synchronization**: Verify if database state is overwriting game object state
  3. **Game Restoration**: Check if game is being restored from database between calls
  4. **Race Conditions**: Investigate potential race conditions in order processing
  5. **State Persistence**: Verify game state persistence mechanism
- **Workaround**: Use `/orders <game_id> <order1>; <order2>; <order3>` format (though this may have same issue)
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Affects core gameplay functionality
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days for root cause identification and fix

### 3. **Retreat, Build, and Destroy Order Implementation** (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Current Status**: Order specification updated with comprehensive retreat/build/destroy rules
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Current test suite covers ~40% of order specification
  - ‚úÖ **Currently Tested**: Movement (`-`), Support (`S`), Convoy (`C`), Hold (`H`) orders
  - ‚ùå **Missing Tests**: Retreat, Build, Destroy orders and phase-specific validation
  - ‚ùå **Missing Implementation**: All three new order types not implemented in OrderParser
- **Implementation Required**:
  - **OrderParser Updates**:
    - Add parsing for `BUILD` and `DESTROY` order types
    - Add parsing for retreat orders (same format as moves but different validation)
    - Update validation to check phase appropriateness
    - Add validation for retreat destination constraints
    - Add validation for build/destroy eligibility
    - Add comprehensive test coverage for all legal/illegal examples from order_spec.md
  - **Game Engine Updates**:
    - Modify `_process_retreat_phase()` to handle retreat orders and automatic destruction
    - Modify `_process_builds_phase()` to handle build and destroy orders
    - Add logic to determine valid retreat destinations
    - Add logic to calculate supply center ownership after Fall moves
    - Add logic to determine build/destroy eligibility per power
  - **Phase System Updates**:
    - Ensure retreats only happen after movement phases with dislodged units
    - Ensure builds only happen after Fall moves (not Spring)
    - Add proper phase transition logic
  - **Database Updates**:
    - Update order storage to handle new order types
    - Add fields for retreat destinations and build/destroy specifications
  - **API Updates**:
    - Update order submission endpoints to handle new order types
    - Add validation for phase-appropriate orders
    - Update order display to show retreat/build/destroy orders
  - **Telegram Bot Updates**:
    - Add UI for retreat order submission
    - Add UI for build/destroy order submission
    - Update order display to show new order types
  - **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
    - Add tests for all legal examples from order_spec.md
    - Add tests for all illegal examples from order_spec.md
    - Add phase-specific validation tests
    - Add complex edge case scenarios (retreat conflicts, build restrictions, etc.)
- **Priority**: HIGH - Essential for complete Diplomacy gameplay
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days (including comprehensive test coverage)
