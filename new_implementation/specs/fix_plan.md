## Priority Assessment Summary

**Immediate Next Steps (Based on Telegram Bot Goal):**
1. **Documentation & Polish** - Complete all missing documentation and code polish
2. **Telegram Bot Development** - Core bot interface for player interaction
3. **HTTP API Layer** - RESTful API for bot-server communication
4. **User Management** - Telegram user registration and game participation
5. **Game Automation** - Remove need for central game master

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0: Documentation & Polish (Estimated 1-2 weeks) **[HIGHEST PRIORITY]**
- Complete comprehensive README files for all modules
- Add missing docstrings and type hints throughout codebase
- Create getting started guide and installation instructions
- Document API endpoints and server configuration
- Add code examples and usage patterns
- Polish existing code for production readiness

### Phase 1: Telegram Bot Foundation (Estimated 2-3 weeks)
### Phase 2: Telegram Bot Foundation (Estimated 2-3 weeks)
- Set up Python Telegram Bot with basic commands
- Implement HTTP API layer for bot-server communication
- Create user registration and game joining system
- Add basic order submission and game state querying
- Implement turn notifications via Telegram

### Phase 3: Game Automation & Polish (Estimated 2-3 weeks)
- Add automated game creation and player matching
- Implement turn deadline enforcement and processing
- Add retreat and adjustment phases
- Create map visualization and game status reporting
- Add diplomacy messaging between players

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Production (Estimated 2-3 weeks)
- Database integration for persistent game storage
- Tournament and leaderboard systems
- Map image generation and advanced visualizations
- Production deployment with monitoring
- Performance optimization and scaling

## [DONE] Deadline-based turn processing (background scheduler)
- Implemented deadline-based turn processing using FastAPI's modern lifespan API for background tasks.
- Removed all fallback and threading-based code; only lifespan API is supported.
- Added `/scheduler/status` endpoint to verify scheduler is running.
- Documented the scheduler and all related endpoints with clear docstrings.
- Added `test_api_scheduler.py` to test the scheduler status and deadline endpoints; all tests pass.
- Code is strict-typed, Ruff-compliant, and follows best practices.

## Notes
- âœ… All core engine functionality is complete and tested
- ðŸ¤– Telegram bot provides accessible, mobile-friendly interface
- ðŸ“‹ Removes need for central game master through automation
- ðŸ”§ Much simpler than web interface while providing rich functionality
