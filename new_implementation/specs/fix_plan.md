# Diplomacy – Next Steps (Spec-Only Alignment)

## Completed (2025-01-31)

- ✅ Fixed test_api_games_list.py to properly skip when DB not configured
- ✅ Expanded DAIDE edge-case tests with strict error reporting:
  - Added comprehensive malformed HLO message tests (8 scenarios)
  - Added comprehensive malformed ORD message tests (10 scenarios)
  - Added tests for missing context (ORD before HLO)
  - Added tests for invalid game state scenarios
  - Improved DAIDE protocol error handling with specific error messages
  - All 6 new DAIDE error handling tests passing
- ✅ Fixed code quality issues:
  - Cleaned up unused imports in test files
  - All Ruff linting checks passing
  - Fixed test skipping for integration tests requiring database
- ✅ Verified API models match `specs/data_spec.md` specifications:
  - UnitOut includes `coast` field for multi-coast provinces
  - PowerStateOut includes all required fields
  - GameStateOut matches spec structure
  - All models use proper Pydantic v2 BaseModel
- ✅ Database indexes verified via Alembic migrations:
  - Indexes on game_id for all tables (per spec)
  - Indexes on power_name for player queries
  - Indexes on turn_number for historical queries
  - Composite indexes for common query patterns
- ✅ CI configuration updated:
  - Added PostgreSQL service setup for database tests
  - Configured to run full integration tests with DB on Python 3.11
  - Database migrations run automatically in CI
  - Tests properly skip when database not configured

## Completed (2025-10-31)

- ✅ Database schema aligned with models:
  - Added missing columns to games table (game_id, current_turn, current_year, current_season, current_phase, phase_code, status, created_at, updated_at)
  - Renamed `power` to `power_name` in players table to match model
  - Added missing columns to players table (is_eliminated, home_supply_centers, controlled_supply_centers, orders_submitted, last_order_time, created_at)
  - Made `state` column nullable (legacy column, not used by new GameModel)
  - Created migrations: `d9ade8d1818f`, `bd48b54f9c5f`, `bf605311f906`
- ✅ Fixed database service `create_game` to properly handle game_id parameter
- ✅ Fixed API list_games endpoint to handle missing is_active attribute
- ✅ Test suite progress:
  - 346 tests collected
  - 267 tests passing (77% pass rate)
  - Significant improvement from initial database schema mismatches
  - Core API endpoints working with configured database

## Remaining Tasks

- Fix remaining 72 failing tests (mostly DAIDE protocol and integration tests)
- Fix 12 test errors (mostly demo game management)
- Monitor performance in production; adjust indexes/migrations as needed
- Continue expanding test coverage for edge cases as they arise
