# Fix Plan (Updated July 15, 2025)

## Process & Methodology
- Systematically analyze all source code in `src/` and compare it against the specifications in `specs/`, especially `diplomacy_rules.md`.
- Review `fix_plan.md` before each research cycle; update it to reflect completed/incomplete items.
- Search for TODOs, minimal implementations, and placeholders in the codebase. Mark any such items as incomplete in this plan.
- Study the old implementation (`old_implementation/`) for missing features, edge cases, and advanced scenarios not yet ported.
- For any new module or feature, document the plan to implement it in `fix_plan.md` before starting work.
- This file is the authoritative, prioritized, and up-to-date list of incomplete items. Update it as progress is made.
- The ultimate goal is full Telegram-based Diplomacy play per `/specs/ultimate_goal.md`.

- [ ] **Security hardening** - Authentication, authorization, input validation

### 7. Documentation & Polish **[LOWEST PRIORITY]** ðŸ“š
- [x] **Complete comprehensive documentation for all modules**
  - Document core engine components (Map, Game, Power, Order) with examples
  - Document server API and DAIDE protocol usage with code samples

## [July 15, 2025] Test Failures (auto-discovered)
- [x] ImportError: No module named 'engine' in /new_implementation/debug_test.py and /new_implementation/src/engine/game.py. Fixed by using relative imports and correct test invocation.
- [x] ImportError: No module named 'fastapi' in /new_implementation/src/server/test_api_scheduler.py. Fixed by adding FastAPI to requirements.txt and installing dependencies.

All tests pass as of July 15, 2025.

**Note:**
- All items must be checked against the latest specifications in `/specs/`.
- Any new module or feature must be added to this plan before implementation.
- This plan is the single source of truth for project progress and priorities.
