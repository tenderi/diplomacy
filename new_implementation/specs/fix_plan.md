# Status Update (July 14, 2025)

- All 49 tests pass as of this increment. Extra debug logging and exception handling added to server for easier debugging and maintainability.
- No build or test errors detected. All previous priorities are complete and verified by tests.
- New git tag 0.0.20 created and pushed for this increment.

# Core Game Functionality Priorities (Initial Plan)

- Implement core game engine logic (game state, turn processing, order resolution)
- Implement map representation and loading
- Implement player (power) management
- Implement order parsing and validation
- Implement basic server loop to accept and process game commands
- Implement minimal client interface for testing (CLI or API)
- **[IN PROGRESS] Implement test suite for core game logic and order resolution (server test suite started)**
- Document core modules and usage in README
- **[IN PROGRESS] Implement advanced order adjudication and turn processing (real Diplomacy rules, not just stubs)**

# Top Priorities (as of July 2025)

- [x] Implement advanced order adjudication and turn processing (edge cases, convoy paradoxes, support cut, standoffs, dislodgement)
- [x] Expand test coverage for adjudication edge cases (convoy paradoxes, support cut, standoffs, dislodgement)
- [x] Add support for multiple concurrent games and test isolation
- [x] Add REMOVE_PLAYER and ADVANCE_PHASE commands as per extensibility section
- [x] Implement SAVE_GAME and LOAD_GAME commands for persistence
- [x] Implement and test DAIDE protocol support for bot/server communication
- [x] Improve error response structure and consistency (see server_spec.md error handling)
- [x] Enhance logging: add startup/shutdown, game state changes, and structured log output
- [x] Add configuration options for host/port, persistence backend, debug/production mode, and logging
- [x] Review and update all documentation/specs to match current implementation and new features

# Secondary Priorities (After Core is Working)

- Implement DAIDE protocol support for bot/server communication
- Implement web interface (optional, after core and DAIDE)
- Implement advanced features (adjudication edge cases, variants, etc.)
- Expand test coverage (integration, edge cases)
- Add logging and error handling improvements

# Iterative Review and Update
- Regularly review progress on all modules and specs.
- After each implementation or test, update this file to reflect completed/incomplete status.
- Adjust priorities as new requirements or issues are discovered.
- Use subagents or parallel review to accelerate code and spec analysis.
- Remove completed items and add new tasks as needed.
- Always keep this file up to date with the current project state.

# Notes
- Always create or update tests before implementing new features.
- Update this plan as progress is made or priorities shift.

# Completed Tasks

- All order tests pass.
- Enforced strict type annotations for all fields and methods in engine, server, and client modules.
- All core and integration tests pass after typing improvements.
- Implemented map_name support, get_locations, get_adjacency, and validate_location in Map class.
- Added and passed tests for new Map API (locations, adjacency, validation).

- Enforced strict type annotations for all fields and methods in engine, server, and client modules.
- All core and integration tests pass after typing improvements.
- Implemented map_name support, get_locations, get_adjacency, and validate_location in Map class.
- Added and passed tests for new Map API (locations, adjacency, validation).
- Fixed convoyed move adjudication bug by correcting order parsing for multi-word convoy targets and implementing proper convoy availability checking.
- Fixed dislodgement logic bug by implementing correct Diplomacy rules where attacker must have greater strength than defender to succeed (equal strength = standoff).
- Updated test_convoyed_move to properly test supported convoyed attack (strength 2) vs defender (strength 1).
- All adjudication tests now pass with proper Diplomacy rule implementation.
- Implemented comprehensive iterative adjudication algorithm for support cut by dislodgement.

- Added extra debug logging and exception handling to server command processing for easier debugging and maintainability.

# Bugs
- No known bugs at this time. All tests passing.

# Previously Fixed Bugs
- [x] BUG: Convoyed move adjudication is incorrect. Army does not move to destination when convoyed (see test_convoyed_move failure in test_adjudication.py).
  - FIXED: Corrected OrderParser to handle multi-word convoy targets (e.g., "A LON - BEL" instead of just "A")
  - FIXED: Implemented proper convoy availability checking in adjudication logic
  - FIXED: Updated test to use supported attack for proper convoy success demonstration
- [x] BUG: Dislodgement logic is incorrect. Defending unit is not removed from province when dislodged (see test_dislodgement failure in test_adjudication.py).
  - FIXED: Implemented correct Diplomacy rules where attacker needs greater strength (not equal) to succeed
  - FIXED: Equal strength attacks now properly result in standoffs as per official Diplomacy rules
  - FIXED: Dislodgement now works correctly when supported attacks overcome defending units
- [x] BUG: Support cut by dislodgement is incorrect. Supporting units that are dislodged should have their support cut (see test_support_cut_by_dislodgement failure in test_adjudication.py).
  - FIXED: Implemented comprehensive iterative adjudication algorithm that properly handles support cut by dislodgement
  - FIXED: Algorithm now correctly identifies when supporting units would be dislodged and removes their support
  - FIXED: All adjudication edge cases now work correctly including convoy disruption, support cut, standoffs, and dislodgement

## Progress Log

- [x] Read and analyzed `agent.md` for workflow and requirements.
- [x] Studied `/new_implementation/specs/fix_plan.md`, `/new_implementation/specs/server_spec.md`, `/new_implementation/specs/diplomacy_rules.md`, and related files to identify top priorities.
- [x] Identified the top 10 missing/incomplete server functionalities, with "advanced order adjudication and turn processing" as the highest priority.
- [x] Reviewed the current implementation of adjudication logic in `/new_implementation/src/engine/game.py` and the test coverage in `/new_implementation/src/engine/test_adjudication.py`.
- [x] Ran the adjudication test suite (`pytest new_implementation/src/engine/test_adjudication.py`), which revealed that 8/9 tests pass, but `test_support_cut_by_dislodgement` fails.
- [x] Diagnosed the bug: support cut by dislodgement is not handled correctly in the adjudication logic.
- [x] Edited `/new_implementation/src/engine/game.py` to fix the logic for support cut by dislodgement (only count support from non-dislodged units when rechecking).
- [x] Re-ran the test suite, but the same test still fails.
- [x] Iterated on the adjudication logic, ensuring the support cut by dislodgement rule is implemented per Diplomacy rules, including cascade handling and correct dislodged unit tracking.
- [ ] (In progress) Finalize and verify the fix for support cut by dislodgement so all adjudication tests pass.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Once all adjudication tests pass, update this plan and proceed to the next top-priority server feature.
- [ ] Continue to ensure all code is strictly typed, Ruff-compliant, and well-documented.
- [ ] Update documentation and this plan as required after each increment.
