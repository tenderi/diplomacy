## Recently Completed Issues âœ… **RESOLVED**

### **Demo Game Map Visualization Issues** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Map generation had `'dict' object has no attribute 'split'` error
- **Impact**: Order visualization maps failed to generate properly
- **Root Cause**: Order visualization data format mismatch in map rendering
- **Solution**: Updated `_draw_moves_visualization` method to handle both dictionary and legacy string formats
- **Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - All map visualization working correctly

### **Demo Game Unit Tracking Issues** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Demo script tried to move units from wrong locations
- **Impact**: Demo game generated invalid orders (e.g., trying to move `A SIL` when unit is in `A BUR`)
- **Root Cause**: Demo script didn't track unit position changes correctly
- **Solution**: Created dynamic order generation based on current unit positions and phase-aware logic
- **Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Demo game now generates valid orders based on actual unit positions

### **Movement Arrow Visualization Issues** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Movement arrows not visible in order visualization maps
- **Impact**: Order visualization was incomplete and hard to understand
- **Root Cause**: Hex color format not supported by PIL, missing @staticmethod decorator, "pending" status not handled
- **Solution**: Added color conversion, fixed method decorator, handled all order statuses
- **Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Movement arrows now visible with proper color rendering

### **Invalid Adjacency Orders** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Demo script generated invalid orders like `A PAR - BEL` (non-adjacent)
- **Impact**: Demo game showed impossible moves that would be rejected by game engine
- **Root Cause**: Demo script used hardcoded adjacency map instead of actual game engine data
- **Solution**: Replaced hardcoded adjacency with real game engine adjacency validation
- **Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - All generated orders now use correct adjacency rules

## Remaining Test Suite Issues ðŸš¨ **LOW PRIORITY**

### **Additional Test Files** (Priority 3)
- **Problem**: Some test files still use old data structures
- **Files Affected**: `test_consecutive_phases.py`, `test_integration.py`, `test_interactive_orders.py`
- **Impact**: These tests fail but don't affect core functionality
- **Status**: Core tests pass, additional tests need updating
