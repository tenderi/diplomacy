# Unsolicited Movement Bug Investigation Plan (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

## Problem Statement

Between phases 08 (autumn_movement) and 09 (autumn_retreat), units are moving without proper orders:

1. **A VEN -> TYR**: Italy army moving from Venice to Tyrolia (previously reported and supposedly fixed)
2. **A LVP -> CLY**: England army moving from Liverpool to Clyde (should not move during retreat phase - not dislodged)

## Root Cause Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Retreat Order Generation for Non-Dislodged Units

**Location**: `src/engine/strategic_ai.py` lines 82-103

The `_generate_retreat_orders()` method may be generating retreat orders for units that are NOT dislodged:

```python
def _generate_retreat_orders(self, game_state: GameState, power_state: PowerState) -> List[Order]:
    for unit in power_state.units:
        if unit.is_dislodged and unit.can_retreat:  # Check may be insufficient
            if unit.retreat_options:
                retreat_province = unit.retreat_options[0]
                order = RetreatOrder(...)
```

**Issue**: The condition `unit.is_dislodged and unit.can_retreat` may not be properly set, or units may have `retreat_options` populated even when not dislodged.

### Hypothesis 2: Retreat Processing Executes All Movement Orders

**Location**: `src/engine/game.py` lines 614-649

The `_process_retreat_phase()` method may be processing movement orders instead of only retreat orders:

```python
def _process_retreat_phase(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    for power_name, orders in self.game_state.orders.items():
        for order in orders:
            if isinstance(order, RetreatOrder):  # May not be filtering correctly
                # Execute retreat
                order.unit.province = order.retreat_province
```

**Issue**: The type check `isinstance(order, RetreatOrder)` may not be catching all non-retreat orders, OR the orders dictionary still contains movement orders from previous phase.

### Hypothesis 3: Order Clearing Not Working Between Phases

**Location**: `demo_automated_game.py` lines 477-507

Orders from the movement phase may not be cleared before generating retreat orders:

```python
if game_state.current_phase == "Retreat":
    retreats = self.generate_dynamic_orders(game_state)  # Are old orders still present?
    for power, power_retreats in retreats.items():
        self.submit_orders(power, power_retreats)
```

**Issue**: If `game_state.orders` still contains movement orders when entering retreat phase, those might be processed again.

### Hypothesis 4: Phase Transition Not Updating Unit Positions

**Location**: `src/engine/game.py` line 629

Units may have their province updated during movement phase but the game state isn't properly saved:

```python
order.unit.province = order.retreat_province
```

**Issue**: If units are being moved during retreat processing but their position was already changed during movement, this could create phantom movements.

### Hypothesis 5: Map Rendering Showing Wrong Phase Data

**Location**: `demo_automated_game.py` lines 474, 507

The maps labeled "autumn_movement" (08) and "autumn_retreat" (09) may be generated with incorrect game state:

```python
# Line 474: After movement processing
self.generate_and_save_map(game_state, "compliant_demo_08_autumn_movement.png")

# Line 507: After retreat processing
self.generate_and_save_map(game_state, "compliant_demo_09_autumn_retreat.png")
```

**Issue**: `game_state` may be stale or showing units in wrong positions due to timing.

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Add Debug Logging to Retreat Order Generation

**File**: `src/engine/strategic_ai.py`

**Location**: Lines 82-103

Add logging to track:

- Which units are considered for retreat orders
- Unit dislodged status: `unit.is_dislodged`
- Unit retreat options: `unit.retreat_options`
- Whether retreat orders are actually generated
```python
def _generate_retreat_orders(self, game_state: GameState, power_state: PowerState) -> List[Order]:
    logger.info(f"=== Generating retreat orders for {power_state.power_name} ===")
    orders = []
    
    for unit in power_state.units:
        logger.info(f"  Unit {unit}: is_dislodged={unit.is_dislodged}, can_retreat={unit.can_retreat}, retreat_options={unit.retreat_options}")
        if unit.is_dislodged and unit.can_retreat:
            if unit.retreat_options:
                retreat_province = unit.retreat_options[0]
                logger.info(f"    -> Generating retreat order to {retreat_province}")
                order = RetreatOrder(...)
                orders.append(order)
```


### Step 2: Add Debug Logging to Retreat Processing

**File**: `src/engine/game.py`

**Location**: Lines 614-649

Add logging to track:

- What orders exist at start of retreat phase
- Order types being processed
- Which units are actually moving
```python
def _process_retreat_phase(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    logger.info(f"=== Processing retreat phase ===")
    logger.info(f"Orders at start of retreat phase:")
    for power_name, orders in self.game_state.orders.items():
        logger.info(f"  {power_name}: {[f'{type(o).__name__}: {o}' for o in orders]}")
    
    for power_name, orders in self.game_state.orders.items():
        for order in orders:
            logger.info(f"Processing order: {type(order).__name__}: {order}")
            if isinstance(order, RetreatOrder):
                logger.info(f"  -> Retreat order detected, executing...")
            else:
                logger.warning(f"  -> Non-retreat order in retreat phase: {type(order).__name__}")
```


### Step 3: Add Debug Logging to Demo Game Order Submission

**File**: `demo_automated_game.py`

**Location**: Lines 477-507

Add logging before and after retreat order generation:

```python
if game_state.current_phase == "Retreat":
    logger.info(f"=== Entering retreat phase ===")
    logger.info(f"Current orders before generating retreats:")
    for power_name, orders in game_state.orders.items():
        logger.info(f"  {power_name}: {[str(o) for o in orders]}")
    
    retreats = self.generate_dynamic_orders(game_state)
    logger.info(f"Generated retreat orders: {retreats}")
```

### Step 4: Verify Order Clearing Between Phases

**File**: `src/engine/game.py`

**Search for**: Phase transition methods and `clear_orders()` calls

Check if orders are properly cleared when transitioning between phases. Look for:

- Where `game_state.orders` is modified
- Whether old orders persist across phase boundaries
- If `set_orders()` replaces or appends

### Step 5: Check Unit Position Updates

**File**: `src/engine/game.py`

**Location**: Movement resolution logic

Verify that:

- Units only move during movement phase, not retreat phase
- Dislodged units have correct `is_dislodged` flag
- Unit positions are saved correctly after movement
- No duplicate movement logic exists

### Step 6: Inspect Actual Game State at Phase Boundaries

**File**: `demo_automated_game.py`

**Location**: Before/after each `process_turn()` call

Add comprehensive state dumps:

```python
# Before processing
logger.info(f"=== State before processing turn ===")
logger.info(f"Phase: {game_state.current_phase}")
for power_name, power_state in game_state.powers.items():
    logger.info(f"{power_name} units: {[f'{u.unit_type} {u.province} (dislodged={u.is_dislodged})' for u in power_state.units]}")

self.process_turn()

# After processing
game_state = self.get_game_state()
logger.info(f"=== State after processing turn ===")
logger.info(f"Phase: {game_state.current_phase}")
for power_name, power_state in game_state.powers.items():
    logger.info(f"{power_name} units: {[f'{u.unit_type} {u.province} (dislodged={u.is_dislodged})' for u in power_state.units]}")
```

### Step 7: Check A VEN -> TYR Specifically

**Investigation**: Why was this supposedly fixed but still happening?

Review:

- Previous fix for Italy A VEN movement issue
- Order splitting logic in `src/server/server.py`
- Order parsing in `src/engine/order.py`
- Whether Italy has ANY orders for A VEN in autumn movement

### Step 8: Run Demo with Debug Logging

**Command**: `cd /home/tenderi/diplomacy/new_implementation && python3 demo_automated_game.py > debug_output.txt 2>&1`

Capture all debug output and analyze:

- What orders are generated for each phase
- Unit positions at each phase boundary
- Whether non-dislodged units get retreat orders
- Order type distribution in each phase

## Expected Findings

Based on the symptoms, the most likely issues are:

1. **Retreat options populated for non-dislodged units**: Units that didn't move or weren't attacked still have `retreat_options` populated, causing AI to generate retreat orders for them

2. **Order clearing failure**: Movement orders persist into retreat phase and get processed again

3. **Incorrect dislodged status**: Units are marked as `is_dislodged=True` even when they shouldn't be

## Files to Modify

1. `src/engine/strategic_ai.py` - Add debug logging to retreat order generation
2. `src/engine/game.py` - Add debug logging to retreat processing and verify order clearing
3. `demo_automated_game.py` - Add comprehensive state logging at phase boundaries
4. `src/engine/data_models.py` - Possibly add validation to prevent retreat orders for non-dislodged units
