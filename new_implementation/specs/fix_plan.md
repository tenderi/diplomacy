## Critical Data Model Issues (October 2025) ðŸš¨ **HIGH PRIORITY**

### **Order Visualization Data Corruption** ðŸš¨
- **Problem**: Demo game order visualization shows completely incorrect data
  - French movement from ENG to IRI (no unit in ENG)
  - German movement BAL -> BOT and Russian movement BOT -> SWE (no units in these areas)
  - British Fleet in NTH tries to move to both DEN and HEL (impossible)
  - German unit in BUR has French movement arrow to BEL (wrong power)
- **Root Cause**: Fundamental data model inconsistencies between:
  - Game state representation
  - Order parsing and validation
  - Unit tracking and ownership
  - Order-to-unit mapping
- **Impact**: Order visualizations are completely unreliable, making the system unusable for actual gameplay

### **Data Model Implementation Plan** ðŸ“‹

#### **Phase 1: Core Data Structure Overhaul** (Priority 1)
- [ ] **Implement Comprehensive Data Models** (data_spec.md)
  - [ ] Create `GameState` dataclass with proper power/unit/order tracking
  - [ ] Implement `Unit` model with proper ownership and state tracking
  - [ ] Create `Order` hierarchy (MoveOrder, HoldOrder, SupportOrder, ConvoyOrder, etc.)
  - [ ] Add `PowerState` model for player management
  - [ ] Implement `Province` and `MapData` models for map representation

#### **Phase 2: Database Schema Migration** (Priority 2)
