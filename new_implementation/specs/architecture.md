# New Architecture Proposal for Diplomacy Python Implementation

## Modular Structure

- **engine/**: Core game logic (game state, turn processing, order resolution, map, player management)
- **orders/**: Order parsing, validation, and execution logic
- **server/**: Server loop, command processing, and network interface (CLI or API)
- **client/**: Minimal client interface for testing (CLI or API)
- **maps/**: Map files and map loading utilities
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests for all modules
- **utils/**: Shared utilities, constants, error handling, logging

## Key Classes and Responsibilities

- `Game`: Manages game state, phases, and turn processing
- `Map`: Represents the board, locations, and adjacency
- `Power`: Represents a player and their units
- `Order`: Represents a single order (move, support, hold, etc.)
- `OrderParser`: Parses and validates orders
- `OrderResolver`: Adjudicates and resolves orders
- `Server`: Accepts and processes game commands, manages games
- `Client`: Sends commands to server, receives updates (for testing)

## Extensibility and Testing

- All modules should be designed for easy extension (e.g., map variants, new order types)
- Use type hints and docstrings for clarity
- Place tests next to source code or in a dedicated `tests/` folder
- Use dependency injection where appropriate for testability
- Document module APIs and usage in README files

This architecture should be refined as implementation progresses and requirements evolve.
