study /new_implementation/specs/* to learn about the specifications and fix_plan.md to understand plan so far.

The source code is in /new_implementation/src/*

The source code of the examples is in /new_implementation/examples/*. Study them.

Game rules can be found in /new_implementation/specs/diplomacy_rules.md. This is your main source of truth for all game-related functions.

First task is to study @fix_plan.md (it may be incorrect) to study existing source code in src/ and compare it against the specifications. From that create/update a @fix_plan.md which is a bullet point list sorted in priority of the items which have yet to be implemented. Think extra hard and study the old_implementation to plan. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations and placeholders. Study @fix_plan.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete.

Second task is to study existing source code in /old_implementation/ then compare it against the compiler specifications. From that create/update a fix_plan.md which is a bullet point list sorted in priority of the items which have yet to be implemented. Think extra hard and use the old_implementation to plan. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations and placeholders. Study fix_plan.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete.

ULTIMATE GOAL see /new_implementation/specs/ultimate_goal.md If you create a new module then document the plan to implement in @fix_plan.md
