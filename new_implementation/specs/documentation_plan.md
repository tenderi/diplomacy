# Documentation Plan for Diplomacy Python Implementation

## User Documentation
- Overview of the Diplomacy server and its features
- Installation instructions (requirements, setup, running the server)
- How to start a new game, add players, and submit orders
- Example usage (CLI/API commands, sample game flow)
- How to run tests and interpret results
- FAQ and troubleshooting

## Developer Documentation
- Project structure and module overview
- API documentation for core modules (engine, map, power, order, server, client)
- Guidelines for contributing (coding standards, testing, documentation)
- How to add new features or variants
- How to extend or modify the server/client
- How to run and update the test suite

## Documentation Tools and Structure
- Use Markdown for all documentation files
- Place user documentation in a top-level `README.md` and/or `docs/` folder
- Place developer documentation in `docs/` and module-level `README.md` files
- Use docstrings in all public classes and methods for API documentation
- Optionally, use Sphinx or similar tools to generate HTML docs from docstrings

Update this plan as the project evolves and new documentation needs are identified.
